Dragon - Test lets see what some of these options do.

Does anyone have an idea for the theme for the enemies? (monsters/militia/alien/fantasy/horror..Chuck Norris...ect)<\n>
We have a wall, if they break the wall is it instant lose? \n
Or do they still need to reach an objective on the other side?


We should plan for the screen size to be atleast 1024x768, We can do larger if you guys want. I couldn't get the picture.scale function working right on my drone.png. So I scaled it down in GIMP and added a copy here.
